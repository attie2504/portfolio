Hello, my name is Attie Hendriks and I'm 25 years old. I'm currently an electrical engineering master student. Before coming to Enschede I studied physics and computing science in Groningen. I'm taking this course as an elective because I think I will be able to learn a lot, since I didn't have many hands-on projects yet. One of my hobbies is puzzles, for example jigsaw and sudoku but also basically any other kind. Besides that I like drawing, baking and cooking.

The image below shows my workspace. Three points that simulate tinkering are the second screen connected to my laptop, the colored papers below the screen and the notebook that is in front of the laptop. Three things that might improve tinkerability are making more space available, a larger space to make notes or sketches like a whiteboard, or having some small simple tinkering tools around such as tape, paperclips, aluminum foil, etc.
