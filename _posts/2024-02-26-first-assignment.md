- LEGO is one of many (construction) materials which is very apt for tinkering. Why? Come up with your own design of a construction/building block (paper, sketch, 3D model, produce... ) Which technical hurdle do you tackle with this block?

One of the reasons that LEGO is so useful for tinkering is that it is very versatile, you can combine the blocks in many different ways. For my construction/building block, I wanted to come up with something simple but also versatile. I ended up using a deck of cards with cuts at specific places as building blocks, such that they can slide into each other. This way of attaching two pieces by sliding them into each other like that is also sometimes used for wood, and would of course be possible to also make this from wood. In that case it would be important to have the width of the slith equal to the thickness of the wood, and sanded down just a little wider so that the pieces can slide smoothly.

A technical hurdle that is tackled here as well as with LEGOs, is that it is possible to assemble and disassemble something without using glue or anyhting else to keep the pieces in place. Also, when disassembled, the building blocks look exactly the same as before, so you can start over as many times as you want without damaging the pieces.
