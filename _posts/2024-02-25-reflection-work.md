- Tinkering is widely associated with 'trial and error'. Where do definitions coincide and where do they differ?
- Can you take a typical (I-Tech) Electrical engineering related project case and list 5 technical hurdles? to which extent do they allow for a 'playful' approach in tackling them?
- would you go hunting for tinkerspiration? List 5 physical and 5 online resources valuable for an (I-Tech) Electrical engineering specialist
- List 5 domains, challenges or settings in which you would like to apply tinkering. Can you identify some sweet spots, (perhaps beyond the well-known such as STEM education) and can you also define some limitations? Are there 'untinkerable' domains?
