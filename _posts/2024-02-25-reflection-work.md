- Tinkering is widely associated with 'trial and error'. Where do definitions coincide and where do they differ?
- Can you take a typical (I-Tech) Electrical engineering related project case and list 5 technical hurdles? to which extent do they allow for a 'playful' approach in tackling them?
- Would you go hunting for tinkerspiration? List 5 physical and 5 online resources valuable for an (I-Tech) Electrical engineering specialist
- List 5 domains, challenges or settings in which you would like to apply tinkering. Can you identify some sweet spots, (perhaps beyond the well-known such as STEM education) and can you also define some limitations? Are there 'untinkerable' domains?

The definitions of tinkering and 'trial and error' overlap because both are regarding working on something without really knowing how you want to do something beforehand. You just try something and see whether it works. However, an important distinction between both is that with 'trial and error' you do have a clear goal that you want to achieve, otherwise it would also not be possible to have 'error'. Because of this, it is more goal oriented than tinkering and also possibly less creative, since you need to work towards a given goal. When you are tinkering, you don't know beforehand what you will achieve, make or learn, and for 'trial and error' that is more restricted.

Technical hurdles for Electrical engineering could be that (in the case of nano electronics), the things you want to make are at such a small scale that you need specialized equipment to manipulate materials at such a scale. This makes it more expensive and reduces the opportunity for tinkering. Also the kind of materials you need can be expensive and the kind of things you want to measure may require very sensitive equipment. These again reduce the opportunity for tinkering. Possible solutions are using larger scales and cheaper materials, or using software to first create models before making something in the lab.

Software that can be used for modeling can be an accessible source for tinkering, however the software can be expensive as well, or lacking explanation on how to use it, so that also makes it more difficult. Examples for inspiration on tinkering can also be looking up recent papers in the field of nano electronics, since it is relatively new but also very versatile, so many new things are being done. The best source would probably be talking to an expert in a given field within nano electronics, since they have spent a lot more time on thinking about how to apply different principles and ideas.

Tinkering can be used for many domains, within academia or outside. Simply doing things with your hands can help with learning or getting new ideas, so then maybe it doesn't even really matter what you are tinkering, indirectly it might help get new ideas for basically any area of interest or work. Limitations to tinkering are when something becomes unsafe, against the law or when it becomes (too) wasteful, other than that anything is possible.
