- Take a look at the LEGO serious play method. The following book forms a good introduction: LEGO Serious play open source. - Take a look at the sections discussing facilitation - Do adults need a different approach or role in facilitation? Which concepts are relevant?
- Read Invent to Learn chapter 5. Where do Papert and Montessori meet up? is there a fundamental difference in their approach? How well do their mantra's and thoughts on teaching translate to tinkering for 'children of different ages'?
- Read Invent To Learn chapter 9. What are useful pointers for the space (location) and setting? Do you need a designlab/fablab?
- Now get back to your own practice as a designer/engineer:
  - where in a process do you use tinkering?
  - how can you translate a design probl em or research problem into a tinkering playground?
  - what can you use to get unstuck?
  - how do you get in the flow?

Many aspects of facilitating for adults and children are similar. The same components can be used, the only difference is that adults might need more help getting started, since they are not used to just trying something without having a clear goal, and children would need more help reflecting on the things that they made.
The 4 concepts that are mentioned in the LEGO serious play document are planning and preparing, setting the scene, facilitating the process open-endedly and ensuring participants' experience of flow. All of these are important, but they need to be used differently for adults and children. For example, a setting that would be exciting for children would make adults feel like they are doing something childish, so it would not be motivating for them.

In the chapter, 8 points made by Papert are given: 1. learing by doing, 2. using technology as a building material, 3. it should be difficult and fun, 4. students need to learn how to learn, 5. taking enough time, 6. to succeed you need freedom to make mistakes, 7. educators should let students see them struggle, 8. learning about computers is important. A quote from Montessori given in the chapter is "Never help a child with a task at which he feels he can succeed."

Simmilarities between Papert and Montessori are that the student/child is at the center of the learning experience, and not the teacher. The teacher should pay attention to see what the child/student needs, but interfere as little as possible. The only difference seems to be that some points of Papert are more suitable for older students, like learning about technology and using technology as a building material.

Making sure that the space and settings of the tinkering environment are optimally designed is very important. If the space is designed well, it will be easier for the participants/students to be inspired to get started and to create something. Ideally there would be plenty of space, good lighting and organized material resources, making it more comfortable for the participants. This kind of functional design is important, but there are more things to consider. Flexibility of the space is also important, this would make sure that different kinds of projects can be done in the space. Other practical considerations are safety and project storage.

Personally I think it makes sense to use tinkering at the start of the project, when you don't know exactly what you want to do. It can also make sense to use it when you get stuck or when you are not sure what to do next. To get unstuck it is helpful to use a material that is not very valuable, for example scrap paper, or something else that does not produce waste so for example modelling on a computer. To get in the flow, it is important to remember that sometimes you just need to get started and try something, because that might help you see what you can do next.
