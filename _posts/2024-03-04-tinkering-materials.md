- First your main observations during the tinkering sessions. Can you recognise most of the aspects of the framework in action?
- Check up on the concept of Affordance. What is the application to the materials used in tinkering? To what extend are the original definition (Gibson) or the HCI oriented re-definition of Norman useful?
- Read the chapter 'Designing for tinkerability' from Design Make Play. Which criteria for tinkerability are described? Use these for the following table:
- Create a table with a number of tinkering materials (or material groups/collections) on the rows, and in the columns criteria for 'tinkerability' - check additionally the definition of affordance, use other concepts discussed in the lecture. Make sure to add the materials you used in the experiences you described in the previous session.

The framework that was given here is POEMS, which stands for People, Objects, Environments, Messages, and Services. In this case the people are of course the students. Getting started seemed to take some time, since most people are not used to this kind of environment. The most important objects were all of the materials we could use for tinkering, and the environment was the time and space to use these materials, and also the fact that there were many people meaning that you might feel watched as you are trying out different materials.

The criteria mentioned in the chapter are given below:

Immediate feedback

- see the result
- see the process

Fluid experimentation

- easy to get started with
- easy to connect (two different blocks, good connectors)

Open exploration

- variety of materials
- variety of genres (stories, games, animations, simulations, art, music)

These characteristics are used in the table, however many other characteristics were given during the lecture, so some of these are also included in the table.

| Materials           | Immediate feedback on process or result                         | Fluid experimentation                                                                                                                                     | Open exploration                                                                                                                                                                                                         | cheap / failure tolerant                                                                                                                                                     | reversible                     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

| Lego                | Yes, both process and result are immediately visible            | Yes, intuitive so easy to get started with, and obviously easy to connect                                                                                 | In principle there are many different kinds, including many different sizes blocks and also different kinds of building blocks for different purposes. However, usually they are sold in small sets with simmilar blocks | Expensive, but it can be disassembled if a mistake is made, and the blocks are sturdy, so failure tolerant                                                                   | Yes                            |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| Totem maker kit     | Yes, similar to lego                                            | Less fluid because connecting different parts takes more effort since you need screws and a saw to cut the longer pieces                                  | Since you can cut up pieces, there is more freedom in how big the pieces will be. Also the pieces can connect in several different ways, which increases open exploration                                                | Expensive, can be disassembled as well to start over like lego, except for the parts that you have cut up. Sturdy blocks                                                     | Yes, except for the cut pieces |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| Arduino starter kit | No, you need to finish the set up before you can see the result | Less fluid, you need some background knowledge on electronics and parts, otherwise the parts can also be broken                                           | Many different parts that can be connected in different ways, very versatile                                                                                                                                             | Expensive, and some parts can be easily broken. Some knowledge about the materials is needed. But if you know that, it can also be disassembled and made into something else | Yes                            |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| Cardboard / paper   | Yes, similar to lego                                            | Yes, you can't really do anything wrong                                                                                                                   | You can cut it however you want, very versatile                                                                                                                                                                          | Cheap, so if a mistake is made you can start over                                                                                                                            | No                             |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| Fischer-technik     | Yes, similar to lego                                            | Yes, however might be a little less fluid than lego, because there are more different parts and it takes some time to figure out how to connect all parts | Many different parts that can be connected in different ways. Similar to a combination between lego and arduino                                                                                                          | Expensive, but similar to lego so failure tolerant                                                                                                                           | Yes                            |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| Scratch             | Yes, in this case a preview of the program is shown             | Less fluid, you need to spend some time to understand how everything works                                                                                | Very versatile, you can make many different kinds of programs                                                                                                                                                            | Cheap, free online software, also failure tolerant since you can't really cause any real damage                                                                              | Yes                            |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
