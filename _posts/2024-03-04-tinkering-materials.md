- First your main observations during the tinkering sessions. Can you recognise most of the aspects of the framework in action?
- Check up on the concept of Affordance. What is the application to the materials used in tinkering? To what extend are the original definition (Gibson) or the HCI oriented re-definition of Norman useful?
- Read the chapter 'Designing for tinkerability' from Design Make Play 8). Which criteria for tinkerability are described? Use these for the following table:
- Create a table with a number of tinkering materials (or material groups/collections) on the rows, and in the columns criteria for 'tinkerability' - check additionally the definition of affordance, use other concepts discussed in the lecture. Make sure to add the materials you used in the experiences you described in the previous session.
